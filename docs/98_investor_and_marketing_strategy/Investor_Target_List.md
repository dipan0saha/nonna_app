## Outreach Strategy & Prioritization

### Prioritization Framework

**Tier 1: VERY HIGH Priority (Target First)**
- Investors with direct parenting/family portfolio companies
- Female/diverse founder-focused funds (if applicable)
- Strong consumer SaaS + subscription model expertise
- Stage-appropriate (seed-focused, not multi-stage generalists)

**Examples**: Primary Venture Partners (Winnie), BBG Ventures (female founders), Forerunner Ventures (consumer subscription), Homebrew (bottom-up consumer), Unusual Ventures (stage fit), Golden Seeds (female-led), Target Ventures (strategic baby registry fit)

**Tier 2: HIGH Priority (Strong Fit)**
- Top-tier seed VCs with consumer internet focus
- Accelerators with consumer track records (YC, Techstars, 500 Global)
- Strategic corporates with baby product distribution (Target, Walmart)
- Angels with parenting/family content focus

**Examples**: First Round Capital, Initialized Capital, Betaworks, NextView Ventures, YC, Techstars, Cyan Banister, Sahil Bloom

**Tier 3: MEDIUM Priority (Good Fit, More Competitive)**
- Generalist seed VCs open to consumer
- Regional VCs with strong local networks
- Corporate VCs with longer strategic timelines

**Examples**: Greycroft, Lux Capital, RRE Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Keiretsu Forum

### Recommended Outreach Approach

#### Phase 1: Warm Introductions (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Leverage Existing Network**:
   - Ask advisors, mentors, beta users, and friends for introductions to target investors
   - Use LinkedIn to identify 2nd-degree connections to partners at target firms
   - Attend startup events, demo days, and networking sessions to meet investors organically

2. **Build Relationships Before Pitching**:
   - Follow target investors on Twitter/LinkedIn and engage authentically with their content
   - Share Nonna's progress updates publicly (beta milestones, user testimonials) to build visibility
   - Request "feedback calls" rather than immediate pitch meetings (lower pressure, builds rapport)

3. **Prioritize "Quick Win" Warm Intros**:
   - Target 5-10 investors where you have strong mutual connections
   - Ask for double opt-in intros (connection asks if investor is interested before making intro)

#### Phase 2: Strategic Cold Outreach (Weeks 2-6, Parallel to Phase 1)
1. **Personalized Email Campaigns**:
   - Craft highly personalized emails referencing investor's portfolio, thesis, or recent tweets
   - Keep initial outreach to 3-4 sentences: problem, solution, traction, ask
   - Subject line: "Nonna: Private Family Platform (raising $500K seed)" or similar

2. **Application Portals**:
   - Apply through official channels for accelerators (YC, Techstars, 500 Global) and VC firms with online applications
   - Follow up 1-2 weeks later with progress updates if no response

3. **AngelList & Other Platforms**:
   - Create detailed AngelList profile for Nonna
   - Apply to syndicates led by target angels
   - Use platforms like SeedInvest, Gust, or F6S to increase visibility

#### Phase 3: Accelerated Outreach via Advisors/Angels (Ongoing)
1. **Secure 1-2 Angel Investors Early**:
   - Close $50K-$100K from friendly angels or advisors to demonstrate investor interest
   - Leverage their networks for introductions to seed VCs ("X just invested in us, and we're filling out the round")

2. **Create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**:
   - Share genuine progress updates: "Just hit 1,000 beta signups" or "Parents are asking to pay for premium already"
   - Mention other investor meetings (without disclosing names) to signal competitive interest

3. **Investor Update Emails**:
   - Send monthly or bi-weekly updates to investors you've met (even if they passed or haven't decided)
   - Include: 1 metric highlight, 1 customer testimonial, 1 product milestone, 1 ask (intro, feedback, etc.)

### Sample Outreach Email Template

**Subject**: Nonna: Private Family Platform (seed round open)

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of Nonna, a private family platform helping parents share their baby's journey without public social media. We combine photos, events, and baby registries in one invite-only app—solving the privacy concerns 73% of parents have about posting baby photos on Facebook/Instagram.

**Why now**: We're 40% through MVP development, have 500+ beta signups, and user research shows 89% interest from parents. We're raising a $500K seed round to launch in 6 months and hit 10K users in Year 1.

I noticed [specific reference: your investment in Winnie / your thesis on consumer subscription models / your tweet about family tech]. Would love 20 minutes to share our vision and get your feedback.

Are you open to a brief call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, Nonna

- **Traction**: 500+ beta signups, 89% user interest, 40% MVP complete
- **Differentiation**: Only integrated platform (photos + calendar + registry) with role-based UX
- **Business Model**: Freemium SaaS ($6.99/month) + affiliate revenue → 10-15% conversion target
- **Unit Economics**: $10-15 CAC, $120-360 LTV, 3:1+ LTV:CAC ratio projected
- **Team**: [Highlight founder domain expertise, previous startup experience, technical chops]

### What Investors Want to See (Stage-Appropriate for Seed)
1. **Founder-Market Fit**: Do you deeply understand the problem? (You're a parent experiencing this pain)
2. **Product Traction**: Is the product built and are early users engaging? (MVP 40% complete, 500+ waitlist)
3. **Market Size**: Is the market large enough? ($2.1B, 60M parents globally)
4. **Differentiation**: Why will you win vs. FamilyAlbum, Tinybeans? (Integrated features, role-based UX, performance)
5. **Go-to-Market**: How will you acquire users profitably? (Viral invitation model, CAC $10-15, LTV $120-360)
6. **Vision**: What's the 5-10 year endgame? (Private family hub for all life moments, not just babies → strategic exit to parenting platform or baby brand)

## Closing Thoughts

### Key Takeaways for Nonna Fundraising

1. **Lead with Mission + Market**: Investors respond to authentic founder stories (families separated by distance, privacy concerns) combined with large market opportunity ($2.1B)

2. **Emphasize Unique Position**: No competitor integrates photos + calendar + registry. Nonna fills white space in a crowded but fragmented market.

3. **Demonstrate Early Validation**: 500+ beta signups and 89% user interest (from research) prove demand before full MVP launch.

4. **Highlight Unit Economics**: Freemium model with viral invitation loop (1.5+ viral coefficient target) + favorable LTV:CAC (3:1+) shows capital-efficient growth potential.

5. **Target Stage-Appropriate Investors**: Seed investors expect pre-revenue or early revenue. Don't approach Series A/B investors yet. Focus on investors who write $250K-$1M checks.

6. **Leverage Female Founder Angle (if applicable)**: If Nonna has female founder(s), prioritize BBG Ventures, Golden Seeds, Pipeline Angels, and other female-focused funds. They're actively seeking family/parenting startups and can lead or fill rounds quickly.

7. **Build Strategic Relationships**: Target Ventures (Target) and Amazon Alexa Fund are not just investors—they're potential distribution partners for baby registry integration. Approach with partnership angle alongside investment.

8. **Be Patient but Persistent**: Seed fundraising typically takes 3-6 months. Start conversations early, provide regular updates, and maintain momentum by shipping product milestones.

### Success Metrics for Fundraising Process
- **50+ investor conversations** (meetings or calls)
- **10+ warm introductions** to target investors
- **5+ term sheets** or serious interest from qualified investors
- **1-2 lead investors** (writing $250K-$500K checks) who can help fill the round
- **Target close**: $500K-$750K within 3-6 months

### Final Recommendation: Prioritize These 10 First

Based on Nonna's profile, stage, and differentiation, prioritize these 10 investors for initial outreach:

1. **Primary Venture Partners** - Direct portfolio fit (Winnie)
2. **BBG Ventures** - Female founders + parenting portfolio (if applicable)
3. **Forerunner Ventures** - Consumer subscription expertise
4. **Homebrew** - Bottom-up consumer products
5. **Y Combinator** - Top accelerator, consumer track record
6. **Unusual Ventures** - Stage-perfect, operational support
7. **NextView Ventures** - "Everyday economy" thesis fit
8. **Golden Seeds** - Female-led companies (if applicable)
9. **Target Ventures** - Strategic baby registry partnership potential
10. **Initialized Capital** - Product + consumer expertise

**Start with warm intros to these 10, apply to YC/Techstars, and build momentum with progress updates every 2-3 weeks.**
