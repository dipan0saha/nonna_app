## 5. Privacy and Security Strengths

### 5.1 Industry-Leading Privacy Practices

**What Sets Us Apart:**

#### No Data Monetization
- Most apps sell data or use ads → **We don't**
- Most apps track users → **We don't**
- Most apps share with third parties → **We only share with essential service providers (with DPAs)**

#### Privacy by Design
- **Default private:** Profiles are never public
- **Invitation-only:** No one can find or search for profiles
- **Minimal collection:** Only essential data collected
- **Clear purpose:** Each data point has specific, limited purpose
- **User control:** Easy to view, edit, delete data

#### Strong Security
- **AES-256 encryption** at rest (industry standard)
- **TLS 1.3 encryption** in transit (latest standard)
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Database-level access controls
- **JWT authentication:** Secure token-based auth
- **Password hashing:** bcrypt (never plain text)
- **EXIF removal:** Automatic metadata stripping

### 5.2 Child Protection Excellence

**Beyond COPPA Requirements:**

| COPPA Minimum | Nonna App Implementation |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Parental consent required | ✅ Multi-step affirmation process |
| Privacy notice | ✅ Dedicated Children's Privacy Policy |
| Parental access to data | ✅ In-app access + export feature |
| Reasonable security | ✅ Industry-leading encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3) |
| Limited collection | ✅ Only name, birth date, photos (all minimal) |
| No selling data | ✅ Explicit commitment, no exceptions |

**Additional Protections:**
- ✅ **EXIF removal:** Location data automatically stripped
- ✅ **Private profiles:** Never public, never searchable
- ✅ **Sharing reminders:** Safety warnings on photo upload
- ✅ **Invitation-only:** Parents control all access
- ✅ **Easy deletion:** Simple profile and photo deletion

## 6. User Experience Considerations

### 6.1 Plain Language Commitment

**Challenge:** Legal policies are typically dense and unreadable.

**Our Approach:**
- **Plain language:** Avoiding legal jargon where possible
- **Clear structure:** Numbered sections, table of contents
- **Visual aids:** Tables, checklists, summaries
- **Highlights:** Key points called out

**Readability Metrics:**
- Average reading level: 9th-10th grade (vs. typical legal docs at college level)
- Use of "you" and "we" (conversational tone)
- Short sentences and paragraphs
- Active voice

### 6.2 Consent Flow UX

**User-Friendly Consent:**

#### Registration (Section 3 of Consent Flows)
- **Clear checkboxes:** Not pre-checked, explicit opt-in
- **Policy highlights:** Key points shown inline (not just links)
- **Optional vs. required:** Clear distinction
- **No dark patterns:** No misleading language or hidden options

#### Parental Consent (Section 4 of Consent Flows)
- **Multi-step process:** Ensures parent understands
- **Clear affirmations:** "I am the parent/guardian..."
- **Privacy reminders:** Warnings about photo sharing
- **Safety defaults:** Most restrictive privacy settings by default

#### Notification Consent (Section 6 of Consent Flows)
- **Granular control:** Per-notification-type opt-in
- **Easy withdrawal:** One-tap disable in settings
- **Frequency control:** Real-time, daily, or weekly
- **OS-level permission:** Only requested when user opts in

### 6.3 Accessibility

**Inclusive Design Considerations:**
