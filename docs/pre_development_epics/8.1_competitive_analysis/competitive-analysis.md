## 6. User Experience Analysis

### 6.1 Onboarding Experience

| App | Onboarding Flow | Time to First Value | Complexity |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Nonna App** | Email signup → Create baby profile → Invite family | ~3 minutes | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **FamilyAlbum** | Email signup → Create family → Upload photo | ~2 minutes | ⭐ Simple |
| **Tinybeans** | Email signup → Add child → Invite family | ~3 minutes | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Huckleberry** | Email signup → Baby details → Start tracking | ~5 minutes | ⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Qeepsake** | SMS signup → Choose prompts → Respond | ~1 minute | ⭐ Very Simple |

**Nonna App Considerations:**
- ✅ Onboarding is comparable to competitors
- ⚠️ Could simplify: Make "Invite family" optional in initial flow
- ✅ Time to first value is good (create baby profile)
- 💡 **Suggestion:** Add welcome screens (planned for V2) to explain unique features (Calendar, Registry)

### 6.2 Navigation and Information Architecture

**FamilyAlbum (Benchmark - Good UX):**
- Bottom navigation: Home | Timeline | Family | More
- Simple, predictable structure
- Primary action: Upload photo (always visible)

**Tinybeans:**
- Bottom navigation: Today | Calendar | Journal | Family
- Well-organized but slightly cluttered
- Primary action: Add moment

**Nonna App (Planned):**
- Bottom navigation: Calendar | Registry | Gallery | Profile
- **Strength:** Clear separation of three main features
- **Consideration:** Where to put baby profile selector? (Top bar or separate tab)
- **Recommendation:** Add "Home" tab showing recent activity across all three sections

### 6.3 Target Audience Accessibility

**Grandparent Accessibility (Critical for Nonna):**

| App | Grandparent-Friendly? | Why/Why Not |
|-----|-----------------------|-------------|
| **FamilyAlbum** | ✅ Excellent | Large buttons, simple flow, minimal features |
| **Tinybeans** | ✅ Good | Clean interface, daily emails reduce app dependency |
| **Huckleberry** | ❌ Poor | Too complex, data-heavy, not relevant to grandparents |
| **Qeepsake** | ⚠️ Medium | SMS-based is accessible, but contribution flow unclear |
| **Nonna App** | ✅ **Target: Excellent** | Simple view-only mode for followers, clear actions |

**Nonna App Accessibility Goals:**
- ✅ Large, tappable buttons
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Tooltips for complex features (WCAG AA requirement already in place)
- ✅ Simple "follower mode" - view, comment, RSVP, squish (only 4 actions)
- ✅ Text scaling support (already planned)
- 💡 **Suggestion:** Add "Help" section specifically for grandparents
