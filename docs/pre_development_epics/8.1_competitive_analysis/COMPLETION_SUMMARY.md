---

### Competitor Analysis Summary

#### Primary Competitors

**FamilyAlbum (Market Leader)**
- **Users:** 20+ million globally
- **Pricing:** Free (with ads) / $30-60/year premium

- **Nonna Advantage:** Integrated calendar + registry, ad-free

**Tinybeans (Strong Competitor)**
- **Users:** 5+ million families
- **Pricing:** Free (1GB limit) / $40/year premium
- **Strength:** Photos + basic calendar, daily emails
- **Weakness:** Limited free tier, basic calendar (no RSVP), no registry

- **Users:** 2+ million families
- **Pricing:** Free (limited) / $30/year premium
- **Strength:** Affordable, simple

| **Qeepsake** | Memory journal | Low (different use case) | Different approach (text vs. visual) |

### Feature Comparison Analysis

#### Unique Features (Nonna App)

**Features NO competitor has:**
1. ✅ **Calendar with RSVP** - Coordinate family events
2. ✅ **Integrated Baby Registry** - Purchase tracking with attribution
3. ✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Owner vs. Follower permissions

**Features only Nonna combines:**
