## 11. Questions & Answers

### Q: Can we skip training and learn on the job?
**A:** Not recommended. Learning on the job will cost $60,000+ in wasted time and require extensive rework. Proper training upfront saves time and money.

### Q: Why 6 weeks? Can we do it faster?
**A:** 6 weeks part-time allows team to learn AND work on the project simultaneously. Faster = full-time training (project stops) or rushed learning (defeats purpose).

### Q: What if someone leaves during training?
**A:** All sessions are recorded, and comprehensive documentation is created. New team members can onboard quickly using these materials.

### Q: Can we use only free resources?
**A:** Free resources exist but lack structure, project specificity, and expert guidance. The $10K investment ensures quality, consistency, and immediate applicability.

### Q: How do we measure success?
**A:** Multiple metrics: completion rates, assessment scores, development velocity, test coverage, bug rates, and team satisfaction. See Section 4 for details.

### Q: What if Flutter or Supabase changes significantly?
**A:** Training focuses on fundamentals and best practices that remain constant. Specific version details can be updated quickly. All materials are modular for easy updates.

## 12. Conclusion

Team training is not just a nice-to-have—it's a **critical success factor** for the Nonna App project. With 80% of the team lacking Supabase experience and significant gaps in Flutter, security, and testing practices, the risk of proceeding without training is unacceptably high.

**The choice is clear:**

❌ **No Training:** $60,000+ wasted in first 6 months, high risk, poor quality  
✅ **This Training Plan:** $10,000 investment, 500% ROI, confident team, quality code

### Final Verdict: APPROVED ✅

**Recommendation:** Proceed immediately with securing budget approval and booking trainers. Begin training in Week 1 of project kickoff.
