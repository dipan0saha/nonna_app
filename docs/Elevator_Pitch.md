# Nonna - Elevator Pitches

**Private. Organized. Connected.**

## 1. Elevator Pitch for Investors

**"Bringing families closer, one baby at a time—and capturing a $2.1 billion market opportunity."**

Nonna is the all-in-one private family platform that solves a critical problem for 60 million smartphone-using parents globally: how to share their baby's journey without sacrificing privacy or juggling multiple fragmented apps.

Here's the problem: 73% of parents are uncomfortable posting baby photos on public social media, 57% of millennials live 500+ miles from their parents, and families are frustrated managing photos on Google, events via email, and registries on Amazon—all separately.

Nonna combines **private photo galleries, family calendars, and baby registries** into one beautiful mobile app designed exclusively for families. Parents create a baby profile, invite up to 20 family members (free tier), and share photos, coordinate events, and manage registries—all in one private space with real-time updates under 2 seconds.

**What makes us different:** We're the only platform integrating all three features (photos, calendar, registry). Competitors like FamilyAlbum and Tinybeans only do photos. We have role-based architecture optimized for both parents and family members, gamification features that drive engagement, and a modern tech stack (Flutter + Supabase) delivering performance that competitors can't match.

**Business model:** Freemium subscription at $6.99/month (15GB free, unlimited premium), with secondary revenue from registry affiliate commissions and print services partnerships. We're targeting 10-15% premium conversion and a viral coefficient of 1.5+, with each parent inviting 5+ family members.

**Traction:** We've completed requirements gathering, technical architecture, and 40% of MVP development. We have 500+ beta signups, validation from 500 surveyed parents (89% expressed strong interest), and preliminary partnership discussions with Amazon and Shutterfly.

**The ask:** We're raising $500K-750K seed funding to complete our MVP in 6 months, acquire our first 10,000 users, and reach Series A milestones. With this funding, we'll capture the white space in family communication that no competitor has addressed—and build a defensible, profitable business with network effects and data lock-in.

**Expected return:** 5x-10x in 3-5 years through strategic acquisition by parenting app companies, baby product brands, or social platforms. The market has never been more ready—let's bring families closer together.

## 2. Elevator Pitch for Users (Parents)

**"Your baby's entire journey—photos, events, registry—all private, all in one beautiful app."**

Remember the last time you wanted to share baby photos with your family, but didn't want to post them on Facebook for the whole world to see? Or when your mom asked about the baby shower details, your sister wanted the registry link, and your best friend needed last month's photos—and you had to check three different apps and send five separate messages?

That's exactly why we built Nonna.

Nonna is your **private family hub** where you can share your baby's entire journey with the people who matter most—and only those people. No strangers, no ads, no algorithms hiding your posts.

**Here's how it works:** You create a baby profile with their name, photo, and due date. Then you invite your family and close friends—grandparents, aunts, uncles, whoever you want. From there, everything lives in one place:

📸 **Photos:** Upload unlimited photos (premium) or 15GB free—that's about 7,500 photos. Family can "squish" (our word for like), comment, and relive memories. We'll even show you "On this day last year..." moments.

📅 **Calendar:** Create events like ultrasounds, gender reveals, baby showers, or the first birthday party. Family can RSVP, you can share video call links, and everyone gets reminders. No more group text chaos.

🎁 **Registry:** Build your baby registry right in the app. When family shops, they can see baby photos while browsing—and the app prevents duplicate gifts automatically. One less thing to worry about.

🎮 **Fun Features:** Let family vote on baby names, predict the gender and birth date, and see who's the most engaged grandparent or aunt. It's the little touches that make everyone feel connected.

**Why families love Nonna:**

✅ **Private by design:** Invite-only. Your photos never leave your family circle.  
✅ **All in one place:** Stop juggling Google Photos, email threads, and Amazon links.  
✅ **Real-time:** Grandma sees new photos in under 2 seconds—faster than any competitor.  
✅ **Built for everyone:** Simple enough for your 70-year-old parents, beautiful enough for you.  
✅ **Free to start:** 15GB storage and all features free. Premium is just $6.99/month for unlimited storage.

Whether you're expecting, just brought baby home, or celebrating their second birthday, Nonna keeps your family connected—no matter how far apart you live.
