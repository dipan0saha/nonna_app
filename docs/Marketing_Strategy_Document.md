### Content Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Privacy & Safety (40% of content)
**Objective**: Position Nonna as the safe alternative to public social media

**Content Types:**
- **Carousel Posts**: "5 Reasons Parents Are Leaving Facebook for Private Family Apps"
- **Reels**: "POV: You want to share baby photos but Instagram feels too public" (15-30 sec)
- **Stories**: Poll "Do you feel comfortable posting baby photos on public social media?"
- **Static Posts**: Infographic showing privacy features (invite-only, encryption, no ads)

**Copy Framework:**
```
Hook: "73% of parents are uncomfortable sharing baby photos publicly."
Problem: "But Facebook and Instagram expose your baby to unknown audiences."
Solution: "Nonna is private by design—invite-only access, no strangers, no ads."
CTA: "Download Nonna and keep your baby's photos where they belong: with family."
```

**Example Post:**
```
📸 Stop sacrificing your baby's privacy for family connection.

Every photo you post on Instagram lives forever on public servers.
Every stranger who views your profile can see your baby's face.
Every algorithm decides who in your family actually sees your updates.

It doesn't have to be this way.

Nonna is built for families, not followers:
✅ Invite-only (no strangers)
✅ Private by design (encrypted photos)
✅ All family sees everything (no algorithms)

Your baby's journey should be shared with people who matter—not the entire internet.

### Content Strategy

#### Approach 1: Authentic Problem-Solving (70% of activity)
**Objective**: Build trust through helpful, non-promotional contributions

**Tactics:**
- Answer questions genuinely without mentioning Nonna
- Provide value: share tips, resources, personal experiences
- Build karma and credibility over time
- Earn the right to occasionally mention Nonna when relevant

**Example Comment:**
```
[On a post asking: "How do you share baby photos with family without using Facebook?"]

Hey! We went through the same thing. Didn't want baby photos on Facebook but needed to keep everyone updated.

We tried a few different approaches:

1. **Google Photos shared albums** - worked okay but family never figured out how to comment or interact. Felt one-directional.

2. **Family group chat** - got chaotic fast. Grandparents missed messages in the constant scroll.

3. **Email** - too formal and nobody checks email anymore lol.

4. **Private family apps** - we ended up trying a few. Some are photo-only which was limiting. We found one that does photos + calendar + registry all in one (happy to share if you want, don't want to be spammy).

The key is finding something simple enough for grandparents but full-featured for you. Good luck!

[If someone replies asking which app]:
"We use Nonna—it's invite-only, has photos/calendar/registry, and updates in real-time. Grandparents can actually use it which was huge for us. Free to start."
```

#### Approach 2: "Founder Story" Posts (20% of activity)
**Objective**: Share the origin story and build emotional connection

**Tactics:**
- Post in appropriate communities (r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur, occasionally r/parenting if relevant)
- Be transparent about being founder
- Focus on problem-solving journey, not product promotion
- Invite feedback and genuine discussion

**Example Post:**
```
Title: [r/parenting] I built an app because I was tired of juggling 5 different tools to share baby updates with family

Hey parents! Not sure if this type of post is allowed (mods feel free to remove), but I wanted to share my journey.

When my wife and I were expecting our first child, we lived 1,000 miles from both sets of parents. We wanted to keep them involved but:

❌ Facebook felt too public (didn't want baby photos visible to my high school friends)
❌ Google Photos had no way for family to interact or RSVP to events
❌ We were managing a separate baby registry on Amazon
❌ Event details were scattered across email threads
❌ Grandparents kept asking "where's the registry link again?"

So I built Nonna—a private family app that combines photos, calendar, and baby registry in one place. Invite-only (no strangers), encrypted, and simple enough that my 68-year-old mom can use it.

We launched 6 months ago and now have 10,000+ families using it. Apparently, this was a common pain point!

I'm not here to promote it heavily (happy to share link if anyone's curious), but mostly wanted to say: if you're frustrated by the same things, you're not alone. The tools we have for family communication are fragmented and not designed for privacy.

What are you all using to stay connected with long-distance family? Would love to hear your solutions!

[Edit]: Wow, thanks for all the interest! Link: [link to app store]. And for those asking about specific features, happy to answer questions in comments!
```

#### Approach 3: AMA (Ask Me Anything) Sessions (10% of activity)
**Objective**: Build authority and engage directly with community

**Tactics:**
- Host AMAs in relevant subreddits (r/SideProject, r/webdev, r/FlutterDev)
- Position as "Founder of a family tech startup" not "marketer"
- Answer technical, business, and personal questions
- Be transparent about challenges and learnings

**Example AMA:**
```
Title: [r/SideProject] I'm building a private family app with Flutter + Supabase. 10K users in 6 months. AMA!

Hey r/SideProject!

I'm a developer who built Nonna, a private family platform for new parents to share baby photos, events, and registries with invited family only.

Some stats:
• Built with Flutter (iOS + Android from one codebase)
• Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
• 10,000 users in first 6 months (mostly organic growth)
• Tech stack: Flutter, Riverpod, Supabase, SendGrid, OneSignal
• <500ms response times, <2s real-time updates

Happy to answer questions about:
✅ Technical stack and architecture decisions
✅ Growing without a marketing budget (viral coefficient 1.5+)
✅ Balancing founder/developer roles
✅ Freemium pricing and monetization
✅ Privacy and security (GDPR, encryption, RLS policies)

AMA!

[Answer questions genuinely, share learnings, occasionally link to app when relevant]
```

### Reddit Ads Strategy

**Approach: Skeptical Audience Testing**
- **Objective**: App installs (but tread carefully—Redditors hate ads)
- **Audience**: r/parenting, r/NewParents, r/BabyBumps subreddits
- **Creative**: Text-based ad that looks like organic content
- **Tone**: Conversational, not salesy
- **CTA**: "Learn more" (not "Download now")
- **Budget**: $1K/month (test only—Reddit ads are hit or miss)

**Example Ad Copy:**
```
[Headline]: "Stop juggling 5 apps to share baby updates with family"

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Low Organic Reach**

- **Solution**: Diversify across multiple channels; invest in paid ads; build owned community (email list, Facebook group)

**Challenge 2: Ad Fatigue**
- **Risk**: Audience sees same ads repeatedly, CTR drops
- **Solution**: Rotate creative weekly; A/B test aggressively; create 20+ ad variations

**Challenge 3: Negative Feedback**
- **Risk**: Public complaints or bad reviews damage brand
- **Solution**: Respond professionally and quickly; fix legitimate issues; leverage positive reviews; implement feedback loop

**Challenge 4: Competitor Copying**
- **Risk**: Larger competitors copy Nonna features
- **Solution**: Move fast on product innovation; build strong brand loyalty; focus on superior execution and community

**Challenge 5: Low Conversion Rate**
- **Risk**: High awareness but low app downloads
- **Solution**: Optimize app store listing (ASO); simplify onboarding; offer incentives; test different CTAs
