# Real-Time Test Reports

This directory contains test reports and performance metrics for real-time subscription tests.

## Report Types

### 1. Test Results (JSON)
Generated by running:
```bash
flutter test --reporter json test/integration/realtime/ > test/integration/realtime/test_reports/test_results.json
```

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Subscription latency measurements
- Throughput benchmarks
- Memory usage statistics
- Connection stability metrics

### 3. Coverage Reports
Generated by running:
```bash
flutter test --coverage test/integration/realtime/
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

## Viewing Reports

Reports are generated during CI/CD pipeline execution and can be viewed:
- In GitHub Actions artifacts
- Locally after running tests
- In test summary dashboards

## Performance Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Subscription Latency | < 2s | ✅ |
| Concurrent Subscriptions | 15+ tables | ✅ |
| Memory Leaks | 0 | ✅ |
| Error Rate | < 1% | ✅ |

## Automated Reporting

Test reports are automatically generated on:
- Pull request creation
