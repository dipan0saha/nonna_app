# Seed Data

This directory contains comprehensive test data for the Nonna App database.

## Quick Start

### Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Ensure Supabase is running locally
supabase start

# Load seed data
supabase db seed
```

### Using psql

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql "your-connection-string" -f seed_data.sql
```

## Data Contents

- **150 User Profiles** (30 owners + 120 followers)
- **10 Baby Profiles** (10 different families)
- **150 Baby Memberships** (access control relationships)
- **150 User Stats** (gamification data)
- **Tile System Configuration** (UI layouts)

### Distribution per Baby:
- 3 Owners (Mother, Father, Grandparent/Caregiver)
- 12 Followers (Extended family and friends)

## Full Documentation

See **[docs/SEED_DATA_GUIDE.md](../../docs/SEED_DATA_GUIDE.md)** for:
- Detailed instructions (3 methods)
- Manual auth.users setup
- Validation queries
- Troubleshooting
- Data structure documentation

## Data Structure

```
10 Babies (Johnson, Davis, Smith, Brown, Wilson, Martinez, Garcia, Lee, Anderson, Taylor)
├── Baby 1 (Johnson)
│   ├── 3 Owners: Sarah, Michael, Mary
│   └── 12 Followers: Grandma Emma, Aunt Olivia, Uncle Liam, etc.
├── Baby 2 (Davis)
│   ├── 3 Owners: Emily, John, Grace
│   └── 12 Followers: ...
└── ... (8 more babies)
```

## Verification

After loading, verify with:

```sql
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles) as profiles,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.baby_profiles) as babies,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.baby_memberships WHERE role='owner') as owners,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.baby_memberships WHERE role='follower') as followers;
```

Expected result:
```
profiles | babies | owners | followers
---------|--------|--------|----------
   150   |   10   |   30   |   120
```

## Notes

- Uses mock UUIDs for testing
- Production apps should use Supabase Auth API for auth.users
- All data respects foreign key relationships
- Designed for development and testing only
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Generated By

This seed data was generated using `/tmp/generate_seed_data.py` to ensure consistency and correct relationships.
