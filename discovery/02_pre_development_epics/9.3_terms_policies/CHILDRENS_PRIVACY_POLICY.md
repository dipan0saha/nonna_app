## Important Notice to Parents and Guardians

**Nonna App is designed for parents and family members to share information about children, not for use by children themselves.**

**Account holders must be 18 years or older.** When you create a baby profile, you are providing information about a child. This Children's Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect that information.

**By creating a baby profile, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of the child and have the authority to consent to the collection and use of the child's information as described in this policy.**
